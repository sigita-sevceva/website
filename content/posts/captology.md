## And Did A Small Research on Surveillance Capitalism

### Background
This research was part of my Human Rights, Ethics and Technology study course
at TalTech. In this paper, I looked at the notion and examples of captology
with the aim to argue whether such infrastructure of surveillance economy is not in tension with freedom in a general sense as well as human rights and individual autonomy, which serve as some of the key foundations of democratic life. Captology refers to the persuasive and cognitive control by intelligent technology means. Furthermore, sass surveillance capitalism is derivative term of a novel yet widely debated and questioned business model which uses consumer’s data to create behaviour prediction models, later to be traded in behaviour future markets and utilised to modify or influence the human behaviour, to guarantee certain outcomes through the use of digital solutions and experiments for financial or commercial gain. There have been many concerns raised about the effect of surveillance economy on such basic human rights as autonomy and privacy, and its impact on the very essence of democratic life, which is further analysed from the perspective of potential ethical implications of captology.

### What I Found Out
I looked into the concept of surveillance capitalism which represents a captological business model in the cyberspace, which, as opposed to selling user’s personal data and interests to third parties for financial gain, describes how ICT companies observe and predict human behaviour on the Internet by using complex computational algorithms, later selling this gathered data, also known as behavioural futures, to third parties with the intent to modify the individual’s further trends and patterns on the Internet to influence a certain outcome. Several examples of surveillance economy were reviewed: starting from a historical perspective on ‘spy’ satellites and space as well as military surveillance; data collection on user preferences and targeted advertising; China’s Social Credit System for rules and ethics compliance, which determines certain privileges that a person is or is not able to enjoy; mobile health service and tracking applications; as well as social media platform use of behavioural futures for yielding certain outcomes, ranging from buying particular products, visiting certain places, watching a specific movie, engaging the individual for a longer time spent on a certain platform, to even interfering in political processes such as elections. Surveillance economy has raised many concerns regarding the ethicality as well as morality, especially in terms of personal autonomy, which is a crucial part of human rights that should be enjoyed as offline, so online. This normalisation of captological processes of artificial intelligence and persuasive technologies, if not handled and supervised properly, seem to pose subtle threat to the democracy on the cyberspace, as surveillance economy operates by generating profit and commodifying human behaviour. In conclusion, I saw several ethical implications of surveillance capitalism which should be looked into and dealt with in order not to gradually arrive at a situation where we as individuals possess practically no control over our own human rights on the Internet.
